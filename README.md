# **Exploratory Data Analysis on Automobile-dataset**

* Project Purpose
  
  Purchasing and choosing a car can be a daunting task, especially if you are concerned with car performance, fuel consumption, body shape, price, horsepower etc.
  The purpose of this project was to focuses on using exploratory data analysis (EDA), to give the consumer enough information to decide which 
  automobile to select. The other objective was to clean, sanitize and explore the automobile dataset.

* The data analysis was performed using Pandas and Numpy for data manupulation and Analysis

* The data visualization and analysis was performed using seaborn and Matplotlib

## Conclusion

The most important thing to consider when purchasing an automobile that is contained in the data set, would be horsepower, fuel type, drive-wheels and pricing. These factors can help you narrow your selection when it comes to the type of automobile you want. The visualization of the automobile dataset helps the consumer to select the best option. The visualization helps compare automobiles based on different factors, than just looking for a particular brand of automobile.
